This is the application that we've been building in class. I'll try to save out the state for each lecture with notes.

As always, if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. 

## What's it doing?

So far we've created the `sql` we need for our database and we went over `PDO` in PHP. We've successfully been able to connect to our DB and `SELECT` all our data. 

We then refactored our code from a procedural mess into classes that each have specific tasks.
